## Writing Standards

### Target Audience Profile

**Primary Audience**: Senior developers with 5+ years of experience who are:
- Experiencing AI productivity plateaus in their development workflow
- Seeking practical, immediately implementable solutions
- Familiar with modern development tools and frameworks
- Value technical accuracy over marketing language
- Need proven strategies with measurable outcomes

**Technical Expertise Level**: 
- Advanced knowledge of at least one major framework (Angular, React, Node.js)
- Experience with AI development tools (GitHub Copilot, ChatGPT, Claude)
- Understanding of software architecture and design patterns
- Familiarity with CI/CD, testing, and deployment practices

### Tone and Voice Guidelines

**Professional Authority**: Write with confidence backed by technical expertise and real-world experience. Avoid hedging language unless genuine uncertainty exists.

✅ **Correct**: "This approach increases code generation accuracy by 40-60% in Angular applications."
❌ **Avoid**: "This might possibly help improve your code generation somewhat."

**Practical Focus**: Prioritize actionable advice over theoretical concepts. Every principle should include immediate implementation steps.

✅ **Correct**: "Replace generic variable names with domain-specific context: `userAuthenticationService` instead of `service`."
❌ **Avoid**: "Consider the philosophical implications of naming in software development."

**Respectful Expertise**: Acknowledge the reader's experience while introducing new concepts. Avoid condescending language.

✅ **Correct**: "While you're already proficient with TypeScript, these context patterns unlock new AI capabilities."
❌ **Avoid**: "As you probably don't know, TypeScript has these basic features..."

### Writing Style Requirements

**Sentence Structure**:
- Use active voice: "Configure the template" not "The template should be configured"
- Vary sentence length: Combine short, punchy statements with detailed explanations
- Lead with action verbs in instructional content
- Limit sentences to 25 words maximum for complex technical explanations

**Paragraph Organization**:
- Start with the most important information (inverted pyramid style)
- Limit paragraphs to 4-5 sentences maximum
- Use transition phrases to connect ideas between paragraphs
- Include subheadings every 200-300 words for scanability

**Technical Language Balance**:
- Use industry-standard terminology without excessive jargon
- Define acronyms on first use: "Progressive Web Application (PWA)"
- Explain complex concepts with familiar analogies where appropriate
- Maintain consistency in technical term usage throughout content

### Content Organization Principles

**Logical Progression**:
1. **Problem Context**: Establish the specific issue being addressed
2. **Solution Overview**: Provide a clear, concise explanation of the approach
3. **Implementation Steps**: Detailed, actionable instructions
4. **Validation Methods**: How to verify the solution works
5. **Optimization Opportunities**: Advanced techniques and variations

**Scannable Structure**:
- Use descriptive subheadings that communicate value
- Include bullet points and numbered lists for step-by-step content
- Highlight key concepts with **bold text** for emphasis
- Use code blocks and examples to break up text density

## Technical Content Requirements

**Implementation Feasibility**:
- All code examples must be tested in real development environments
- Include necessary imports, dependencies, and configuration
- Provide complete, executable examples rather than partial snippets
- Test across different operating systems (Windows, macOS, Linux)

**Security Compliance**:
- Never expose API keys, tokens, or sensitive configuration

## Code Example Standards

### Code Block Formatting

**Language Specification**:
Always specify the language for proper syntax highlighting:

```typescript
// ✅ Correct - with language specification
function analyzeRepository(context: RepoContext): Promise<Analysis> {
  return this.aiService.analyze(context);
}
```

**Context Comments**:
Include explanatory comments for complex logic:

```typescript
// Context: Setting up repository analysis with incremental context building
class RepositoryAnalyzer {
  constructor(
    private aiService: AiService,
    private contextBuilder: ContextBuilder // Builds context incrementally for large repos
  ) {}
  
  async analyzeWithContext(repoPath: string): Promise<Analysis> {
    // Step 1: Build lightweight context overview
    const overview = await this.contextBuilder.createOverview(repoPath);
    
    // Step 2: Identify key files for detailed analysis
    const keyFiles = await this.identifyKeyFiles(overview);
    
    // Step 3: Generate focused context for AI analysis
    const focusedContext = await this.contextBuilder.buildFocusedContext(keyFiles);
    
    return this.aiService.analyze(focusedContext);
  }
}
```

**Complete Examples**:
Provide full, executable examples rather than fragments:

```typescript
// File: src/services/ai-context.service.ts
import { Injectable } from '@angular/core';
import { Observable } from 'rxjs';
import { map, catchError } from 'rxjs/operators';

@Injectable({
  providedIn: 'root'
})
export class AiContextService {
  private readonly MAX_CONTEXT_SIZE = 8000; // tokens
  
  constructor(private http: HttpClient) {}
  
  buildContextForAnalysis(files: string[]): Observable<AnalysisContext> {
    return this.http.post<RawContext>('/api/context/build', { files })
      .pipe(
        map(rawContext => this.optimizeContext(rawContext)),
        catchError(error => {
          console.error('Context building failed:', error);
          throw new Error('Failed to build analysis context');
        })
      );
  }
  
  private optimizeContext(raw: RawContext): AnalysisContext {
    // Implementation details for context optimization
    if (raw.tokenCount > this.MAX_CONTEXT_SIZE) {
      return this.truncateContext(raw);
    }
    return raw as AnalysisContext;
  }
}
```

### Code Example Organization

**Progressive Complexity**:
Start with basic examples and build to advanced implementations:

1. **Basic Example**: Core concept demonstration
2. **Practical Example**: Real-world application
3. **Advanced Example**: Production-ready implementation with error handling
4. **Integration Example**: Working within larger application context

**Error Handling Requirements**:
Include proper error handling in all production examples:

```typescript
// ✅ Include error handling and validation
async generateCode(prompt: string, context: Context): Promise<GeneratedCode> {
  try {
    // Validate inputs
    if (!prompt?.trim()) {
      throw new ValidationError('Prompt cannot be empty');
    }
    
    if (!context?.isValid()) {
      throw new ValidationError('Invalid context provided');
    }
    
    // Generate code with retry logic
    const result = await this.aiService.generate(prompt, context, {
      maxRetries: 3,
      timeout: 30000
    });
    
    // Validate generated output
    if (!this.validateGeneratedCode(result)) {
      throw new GenerationError('Generated code failed validation');
    }
    
    return result;
    
  } catch (error) {
    this.logger.error('Code generation failed', { prompt, context, error });
    
    // Provide fallback or rethrow with context
    if (error instanceof ValidationError) {
      throw error; // Let validation errors bubble up
    }
    
    throw new GenerationError(
      'Code generation service unavailable. Please try again.',
      { originalError: error }
    );
  }
}
```
