Pairing sessions with explicit learning objectives create more value than purely productivity-focused sessions.

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid

**Productivity Obsession:**
Teams that focus only on short-term productivity miss the long-term benefits of knowledge sharing and capability building.

**Insufficient Context Sharing:**
Pairs that don't invest in shared AI context experience inconsistent assistance and coordination difficulties.

**Role Rigidity:**
Fixed driver/navigator roles limit learning opportunities compared to dynamic role allocation based on expertise and learning goals.

**Limited Documentation:**
Pairs that don't document learnings miss opportunities to scale successful patterns across the team.
