# Content Style Guide - Beyond the AI Plateau

## Voice and Tone Guidelines

### Expert but Approachable
- Use "This optimization technique reduces compilation time by 40%" not "Obviously, any competent developer would know this"
- Demonstrate expertise through specific examples and metrics
- Respect the reader's intelligence and experience

### Confident yet Humble
- State facts based on testing: "Based on extensive testing with 500+ developers..."
- Acknowledge limitations: "This approach works best for Angular applications with 10+ components"
- Share learnings rather than absolute truths

### Action-Oriented and Practical
- Focus on implementation: "Implement this 15-minute context setup to immediately improve..."
- Provide specific timelines and expected outcomes
- Include concrete next steps

## Writing Style Standards

### Sentence Structure
- Target 15-20 words per sentence
- Use active voice: "Claude Code generates accurate code" not "Accurate code is generated"
- Maintain clear subject-verb-object structure

### Paragraph Organization
- 3-4 sentences per paragraph
- Lead with topic sentence
- Include supporting details
- End with transition or application

## Technical Content Standards

### Code Examples
All code must include language specification:

```typescript
// Correct: Language specified, commented, complete
function optimizeContext(repository: Repository): ContextMap {
    // Generate context hierarchy for better AI comprehension
    return repository.analyze()
        .map(file => generateContext(file))
        .reduce(mergeContexts);
}
```

### Prompt Templates
Required structure:
- Purpose statement
- Variable documentation with {{VARIABLE_NAME}} format
- Usage instructions
- Expected outcomes
- Troubleshooting section

## Terminology Standards

### Product Names
- Beyond the AI Plateau (correct capitalization)
- Claude Code (two words, both capitalized)
- GitHub Copilot (capital G, capital C)
- TypeScript (one word)
- NestJS (official framework name)

### Technical Concepts
- AI-assisted development (hyphenated)
- context mastery (lowercase unless title)
- prompt engineering (lowercase unless title)

## Accessibility Standards

### Heading Structure
- Single H1 per document (title only)
- H2 for major sections
- H3 for subsections
- Logical hierarchy maintained

### Images
- Include descriptive alt text
- Explain relevance to content
- 125 characters or fewer when possible

### Inclusive Language
- Use "everyone" instead of "guys"
- Use "oversight" instead of "blind spot"
- Avoid "obviously," "clearly," "simply"

## Quality Checklist

- [ ] Images include alt text
- [ ] Terminology consistent
- [ ] Links functional

### Content Structure
