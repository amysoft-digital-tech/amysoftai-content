Replace template variables (marked with `{VARIABLE_NAME}`) with your project specifics:
- `{CODEBASE_CONTEXT}`: Your codebase structure and technology stack
- `{REFACTORING_SCOPE}`: Specific area or component to transform
- `{RISK_TOLERANCE}`: Acceptable risk level for the transformation
- `{SAFETY_REQUIREMENTS}`: Testing and validation requirements

#### Step 3: Execute with Safety Validation
1. Copy the template prompt section
2. Replace all customization variables with actual values
3. Execute pre-transformation safety checks
4. Submit to Claude Code for transformation generation
5. Review and validate generated code changes
6. Execute post-transformation verification

#### Step 4: Integrate with Development Workflow
