## Usage Instructions

### Step 1: Code Analysis and Cleanup Planning

**Variable Replacement Guide**:
- `{CODE_LANGUAGE}`: The programming language (e.g., "JavaScript", "Python", "Java")
- `{CODE_PURPOSE}`: Brief description of what the code does (e.g., "user authentication", "data processing")
- `{TEAM_EXPERIENCE_LEVEL}`: Team experience level (e.g., "mixed experience", "junior developers", "senior team")
- `{SPECIFIC_CLEANUP_GOALS}`: Specific goals (e.g., "improve naming", "reduce complexity", "add error handling")
- `{CODE_TO_CLEANUP}`: The actual code that needs cleaning
- `{IDENTIFIED_ISSUES}`: List any specific problems you've noticed

### Step 2: Cleanup Implementation and Validation

**Apply Changes Systematically**:
- [ ] Create backup branch: `git checkout -b cleanup/{feature-name}`
- [ ] Apply suggested changes one category at a time
- [ ] Test functionality after each major change
- [ ] Commit changes with descriptive messages

**Validation Checklist**:
- [ ] All tests still pass (run test suite)
- [ ] Functionality unchanged (manual testing)
- [ ] Code is more readable than before
- [ ] Variable names are clear and descriptive
- [ ] Functions have single, clear purposes
- [ ] Comments explain "why" not "what"

## Common Cleanup Patterns

### Variable and Function Naming
**Before**:
```javascript
const d = new Date();
const u = getUserData(id);
function calc(x, y) { return x * y * 0.1; }
```

**After**:
```javascript
const currentDate = new Date();
const userData = getUserData(userId);
function calculateDiscountAmount(price, discountRate) { 
  return price * discountRate * 0.1; 
}
```

### Function Decomposition
**Before**:
```python
def process_user(user_data):
    # Validate data
    if not user_data.get('email'):
        raise ValueError("Email required")
    if len(user_data.get('password', '')) < 8:
        raise ValueError("Password too short")
    
    # Save to database
    user = User(
        email=user_data['email'],
        password=hash_password(user_data['password']),
        created_at=datetime.now()
    )
    db.session.add(user)
    db.session.commit()
    
    # Send welcome email
    send_email(user.email, "Welcome!", welcome_template)
    
    return user
```

**After**:
```python
def process_user(user_data):
    validate_user_data(user_data)
    user = create_user_record(user_data)
    send_welcome_email(user.email)
    return user

def validate_user_data(user_data):
    if not user_data.get('email'):
        raise ValueError("Email required")
    if len(user_data.get('password', '')) < 8:
        raise ValueError("Password too short")

def create_user_record(user_data):
    user = User(
        email=user_data['email'],
        password=hash_password(user_data['password']),
        created_at=datetime.now()
    )
    db.session.add(user)
    db.session.commit()
    return user

def send_welcome_email(email):
    send_email(email, "Welcome!", welcome_template)
```

### Comment Improvements
**Before**:
```java
// Loop through users
for (User user : users) {
    // Check if active
    if (user.isActive()) {
        // Update last login
        user.setLastLogin(new Date());
    }
}
```

**After**:
```java
// Update last login timestamp for all active users to track engagement
for (User user : users) {
    if (user.isActive()) {
        user.setLastLogin(new Date());
    }
}
```

## Implementation Guide

### Step-by-Step Cleanup Process

**1. Safety First** (5 minutes):
- Create feature branch for cleanup work
- Ensure all tests pass before starting
- Make sure you can revert changes if needed

**2. Quick Wins** (15 minutes):
- Fix obvious variable naming issues
- Remove commented-out code
- Fix inconsistent formatting
- Remove unused imports/variables

**3. Structure Improvements** (20 minutes):
- Break down overly long functions
- Group related functionality
- Improve error handling
- Add missing documentation

**4. Validation and Review** (10 minutes):
- Run all tests to ensure functionality preserved
- Review changes for additional improvements
- Get team feedback on significant changes
- Merge when confident in improvements

### Cleanup Prioritization

**High Priority** (Do First):
- Fix misleading or confusing names
- Remove dead code and unused variables
- Fix obvious bugs or error-prone patterns
- Improve critical path readability

**Medium Priority** (If Time Allows):
- Improve comment quality and usefulness
- Standardize formatting and style
- Simplify complex expressions
- Add defensive programming checks

**Low Priority** (Future Cleanup):
- Optimize for performance (if needed)
- Reorganize file structure
- Update to latest language features
- Comprehensive documentation updates

## Success Metrics

**Immediate Improvements**:
- Code review comments focus on logic, not style
- New team members understand code faster
- Fewer questions about "what does this do?"
- Debugging becomes easier and faster

**Long-term Benefits**:
- Reduced bug introduction rate
- Faster feature development
- Easier maintenance and updates
- Better team collaboration

**Quality Indicators**:
- Functions have single, clear purposes
- Variable names explain their contents
- Code reads like well-written prose
- Minimal need for explanatory comments

## Common Pitfalls and Solutions

**Over-cleaning**: Don't change working code without good reason
**Breaking functionality**: Test frequently during cleanup
**Perfectionism**: Focus on significant improvements, not perfection
**Batch changes**: Make incremental improvements, not massive rewrites

## Integration with Other Templates

**Before Cleanup**:
- Use "Function Decomposition" for complex functions
- Use "Variable Naming Optimization" for naming issues

**After Cleanup**:
- Use "Basic Error Handling" to improve robustness
- Use "Simple Performance Optimization" if needed
- Use "Code Documentation Basics" for documentation

**Team Integration**:
- Use "Code Review Preparation" before submitting
- Use "Knowledge Sharing Basics" to teach cleanup patterns

This template establishes good cleanup habits while building confidence in code improvement. Start with small, safe changes and gradually tackle more complex refactoring as skills develop.
