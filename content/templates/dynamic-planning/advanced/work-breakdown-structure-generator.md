- **Float Analysis**: Free float and total float for non-critical activities
- **Schedule Optimization**: Opportunities for compression and acceleration
- **Risk Mitigation**: Critical path protection and contingency planning

## 4. Quality Assurance and Testing Integration

### Testing Strategy Integration
For each development work package:

**Unit Testing**:
- Test development effort (% of development effort)
- Test execution and validation requirements
- Code coverage targets and quality gates
- Automated testing framework setup

**Integration Testing**:
