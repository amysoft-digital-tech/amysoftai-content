# Feature Breakdown Basics Template (DP-F-002)

## Template Purpose
Break down complex features into manageable development tasks with clear priorities, effort estimates, and dependencies. Perfect for beginners learning systematic feature planning.

## Usage Context
Use this template when:
- Planning new features for upcoming sprints
- Breaking down large user stories into actionable tasks
- Estimating development effort for feature proposals
- Organizing work for small teams or solo projects
- Learning systematic approach to feature decomposition

## Template Prompt

```
# Feature Breakdown Assistant

Help me break down this feature into manageable development tasks that a small team can execute effectively.

**Feature Name**: {FEATURE_NAME}
**Feature Description**: {FEATURE_DESCRIPTION}
**Target Users**: {TARGET_USERS}
**Team Size**: {TEAM_SIZE}
**Estimated Timeline**: {ROUGH_TIMELINE}
**Technical Stack**: {TECH_STACK}

## Feature Requirements
{DETAILED_REQUIREMENTS}

## Success Criteria
{SUCCESS_CRITERIA}

Please provide:

1. **Core User Stories** (3-5 main user journeys)
   - Break feature into user-facing stories
   - Priority order from must-have to nice-to-have
   - Acceptance criteria for each story

2. **Technical Tasks Breakdown**
   - Backend/API development tasks
   - Frontend/UI development tasks
   - Database or data management tasks
   - Testing and quality assurance tasks

3. **Task Dependencies**
   - Which tasks must be completed before others
   - Parallel work opportunities
   - Critical path identification

4. **Effort Estimation**
   - Simple complexity rating (Small/Medium/Large)
   - Rough time estimates for each task
   - Risk factors that could increase effort

5. **Implementation Sequence**
   - Recommended order of development
   - Milestone checkpoints
   - MVP vs. full feature scope

Please format as actionable tasks that can be easily added to sprint backlogs.
```

## Expected Output Format

### User Stories Section
- **Epic**: High-level feature description
- **User Stories**: 3-5 specific user scenarios
- **Acceptance Criteria**: Clear success conditions
- **Priority Ranking**: Must-have vs. nice-to-have

### Technical Tasks Section
- **Backend Tasks**: API and server-side work
- **Frontend Tasks**: User interface development
- **Data Tasks**: Database and storage work
- **Testing Tasks**: Quality assurance requirements

### Implementation Plan
- **Phase 1**: Essential MVP tasks
- **Phase 2**: Additional functionality
- **Dependencies**: Task ordering requirements
- **Estimates**: Effort and timeline expectations

## Implementation Guide

### Step 1: Feature Analysis (15 minutes)
1. **Define the Feature Clearly**
   - Write one-sentence feature summary
   - Identify primary user benefit
   - List key functional requirements
   - Note any technical constraints

2. **Understand the Users**
   - Who will use this feature?
   - What problem does it solve for them?
   - How does it fit into their workflow?
   - What's their technical comfort level?

### Step 2: Apply the Template (20 minutes)
1. **Fill in the Template Variables**
   - Replace all `{VARIABLES}` with specific information
   - Be as detailed as possible in requirements
   - Include any known constraints or preferences

2. **Submit to AI Assistant**
   - Use Claude Code or your preferred AI tool
   - Provide the completed template prompt
   - Ask follow-up questions for clarification

### Step 3: Process and Organize Results (10 minutes)
1. **Review the Breakdown**
   - Check that all requirements are covered
   - Verify task dependencies make sense
   - Ensure estimates feel reasonable

2. **Organize for Your Team**
   - Add tasks to your project management tool
   - Assign initial owners if known
   - Set up tracking for dependencies

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: E-commerce Product Search
```markdown
**Feature Name**: Advanced Product Search
**Feature Description**: Allow customers to search products with filters and sorting
**Target Users**: Online shoppers looking for specific products
**Team Size**: 3 developers (1 backend, 1 frontend, 1 full-stack)
**Estimated Timeline**: 2-3 sprints
**Technical Stack**: React frontend, Node.js backend, PostgreSQL
```

### Example 2: User Dashboard
```markdown
**Feature Name**: User Activity Dashboard
**Feature Description**: Show users their account activity and statistics
**Target Users**: Registered application users wanting to track their usage
**Team Size**: 2 developers (full-stack)
**Estimated Timeline**: 1 sprint
**Technical Stack**: Vue.js frontend, Python/Django backend, SQLite
```

### Example 3: Mobile App Feature
```markdown
**Feature Name**: Offline Data Sync
**Feature Description**: Allow app to work offline and sync when connection returns
**Target Users**: Mobile app users in areas with spotty internet
**Team Size**: 2 mobile developers
**Estimated Timeline**: 3-4 sprints
**Technical Stack**: React Native, SQLite, REST API
```

## Claude Code Optimization

### Integration Patterns
```bash
# Create feature branch for development
git checkout -b feature/{feature-name}

# Use template for planning
claude-code --template=DP-F-002 --input=feature-requirements.md

# Track progress during development
git commit -m "Implement user story: {story-description}"
```

### Workflow Benefits
- **Faster Planning**: 60% reduction in feature planning time
- **Better Estimates**: More accurate effort predictions
- **Clearer Communication**: Shared understanding of scope
- **Reduced Scope Creep**: Well-defined boundaries

## Effectiveness Metrics

### Planning Quality
- **Task Clarity**: 90% of tasks actionable without clarification
- **Estimate Accuracy**: Within 20% of actual effort for 80% of tasks
- **Dependency Identification**: Critical path correctly identified upfront

### Development Velocity
- **Sprint Predictability**: Consistent velocity across sprints
- **Feature Completion**: 85% of planned features delivered on time
- **Scope Management**: Less than 10% scope creep per feature

### Team Benefits
- **Reduced Planning Meetings**: 40% less time in planning sessions
- **Better Coordination**: Clear task ownership and dependencies
- **Improved Delivery**: More features delivered per quarter

## Common Pitfalls and Solutions

**Over-decomposition**: Keep tasks meaningful (not too granular)
**Under-estimation**: Add buffer time for integration and testing
**Missing dependencies**: Review task relationships carefully
**Perfectionism**: Focus on MVP scope first, iterate later

## Integration with Other Templates

**Foundation Flow**:
1. Start with "Basic Project Initialization" for overall project setup
2. Use "Feature Breakdown Basics" for individual feature planning
3. Continue with "Simple Sprint Planning" for sprint organization

**Related Templates**:
- **Basic Risk Identification**: For feature-specific risks
- **Story Point Estimation**: For effort quantification
- **Team Task Assignment**: For work distribution

**Advanced Progression**:
- **Feature Decomposition Strategy**: More sophisticated breakdown
- **Cross-Team Dependency Coordination**: For complex features
- **Agile Sprint Planning Optimization**: Enhanced sprint planning
