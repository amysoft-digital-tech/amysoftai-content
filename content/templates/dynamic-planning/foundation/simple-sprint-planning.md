# Simple Sprint Planning Template

## Overview

This foundational template guides teams through AI-enhanced sprint planning that's approachable for beginners while establishing good practices for future growth. Perfect for new agile teams or teams adopting AI-assisted planning for the first time.

**When to use**: Weekly or bi-weekly sprint planning sessions, especially for teams with 2-5 developers.

**Time investment**: 45-60 minutes planning, 1-2 hours saved through better organization.

**Expected outcome**: Clear, achievable sprint plan with well-estimated tasks and team alignment.

## Template Usage

### Step 1: Sprint Planning Preparation

```markdown
# Sprint Planning Assistant

I need help planning our next sprint. Please help me organize our backlog and create a realistic sprint plan.

## Sprint Context
- **Sprint Length**: [1-2 weeks typical for foundational teams]
- **Team Size**: [Number of developers]
- **Team Capacity**: [Total available hours considering meetings, time off, etc.]
- **Previous Sprint Velocity**: [If known, story points or tasks completed]
- **Key Focus**: [Main goal or theme for this sprint]

## Current Backlog Items
[List your backlog items with brief descriptions]
1. [Feature/Task 1] - [Brief description]
2. [Feature/Task 2] - [Brief description]
3. [Feature/Task 3] - [Brief description]
[Continue with more items...]

## Questions for Planning
1. Which items should be prioritized for this sprint?
2. How should large items be broken down into manageable tasks?
3. What dependencies exist between these items?
4. What are realistic estimates for each task?
5. Are there any risks or blockers we should plan for?

Please provide:
1. Suggested sprint backlog with prioritized items
2. Task breakdown for complex items
3. Effort estimates (in hours or story points)
4. Risk assessment and mitigation suggestions
5. Daily standup question suggestions for this sprint
```

### Step 2: Sprint Commitment and Organization

Process the AI suggestions into your sprint plan:

**Sprint Goals**:
- [ ] Primary sprint objective clearly defined
- [ ] Success criteria established
- [ ] Key deliverables identified
- [ ] Team understands and commits to goals

**Task Organization**:
- [ ] All tasks estimated and assigned
- [ ] Dependencies identified and planned
- [ ] Risks documented with mitigation plans
- [ ] Definition of "done" established for each item

**Team Alignment**:
- [ ] Each team member understands their responsibilities
- [ ] Workload is balanced across team members
- [ ] Buffer time included for unexpected issues
- [ ] Review and retrospective planned

## Implementation Guide

### Sprint Planning Meeting Structure (60 minutes)

**Opening (10 minutes)**:
- Review previous sprint outcomes
- Discuss team capacity and availability
- Clarify sprint goals and priorities

**AI-Assisted Planning (30 minutes)**:
- Use template to get planning suggestions
- Discuss AI recommendations with team
- Adjust estimates based on team input
- Finalize task assignments

**Commitment and Wrap-up (20 minutes)**:
- Confirm sprint commitments
- Set up tracking and communication plan
- Schedule daily standups and sprint review
- Document any concerns or questions

### Daily Standup Enhancement

Use AI assistance for effective standups:

```markdown
# Daily Standup Assistant

Help me prepare for today's standup based on our sprint progress.

## Current Sprint Status
- **Day [X] of [Sprint Length]**
- **Completed Tasks**: [List finished items]
- **In Progress**: [Current work]
- **Planned for Today**: [Today's goals]
- **Blockers/Concerns**: [Any issues]

Questions:
1. Are we on track to meet sprint goals?
2. What should be prioritized today?
3. What risks should we watch for?
4. How can team members help each other?

Please suggest today's standup talking points and any adjustments needed.
```

## Success Metrics

**Sprint Completion Indicators**:
- 80%+ of committed work completed
- No major surprises or unplanned work
- Team satisfaction with planning process
- Clear understanding of what's next

**Planning Efficiency Metrics**:
- Planning meeting stays within time box
- Estimates improve over time
- Fewer mid-sprint scope changes
- Better team workload distribution

**Team Development Signs**:
- Increased confidence in estimation
- Better understanding of dependencies
- Improved communication during planning
- Growing comfort with AI-assisted planning

## Common Challenges and Solutions

**Over-committing**: Start with 70% of estimated capacity to build confidence
**Under-estimating**: Include buffer time and learning overhead
**Scope creep**: Establish clear sprint boundaries and change process
**Team resistance**: Start with familiar processes and gradually add AI assistance

## Integration with Other Templates

**Before Sprint Planning**:
- Use "Basic Project Initialization" for project setup
- Use "Simple Risk Assessment" for understanding project risks

**During Sprint**:
- Use "Daily Progress Tracking" for standup preparation
- Use "Basic Impediment Resolution" for handling blockers

**After Sprint**:
- Use "Simple Retrospective" for improvement identification
- Use "Velocity Tracking Basics" for planning future sprints

## Customization for Different Teams

**New Agile Teams**:
- Focus more on process education
- Use simpler estimation techniques (hours vs. story points)
- Include more explanation of agile concepts

**Remote Teams**:
- Add extra communication planning
- Include time zone coordination
- Plan for asynchronous work coordination

**Mixed Experience Teams**:
- Pair experienced with novice planners
- Use AI suggestions to level knowledge
- Include mentoring time in sprint planning

This template establishes solid sprint planning foundations while introducing AI assistance gradually. As teams become more comfortable, they can adopt more sophisticated planning templates and techniques.
