## Customization Variables

- `{TEAM_CONTEXT}`: Team size, experience, and working style
- `{TECH_STACK}`: Technologies and frameworks being used
- `{TEAM_EXPERIENCE_LEVEL}`: Overall team experience with the technology
- `{SPRINT_LENGTH}`: Duration of sprints (1 week, 2 weeks, etc.)
- `{POINTS_SCALE}`: Fibonacci (1,2,3,5,8,13) or other scale
- `{USER_STORIES_LIST}`: Stories that need estimation
- `{PREVIOUS_COMPLETED_STORIES}`: Past work for calibration reference

## Expected Output Format

### Estimation Framework
- **Point Scale Definition**: What each number means
- **Complexity Factors**: Technical, business, and risk considerations
- **Sizing Guidelines**: Relative comparison approach

### Calibration Set
- **Reference Stories**: Example for each point value
- **Comparison Framework**: How to evaluate new stories
- **Team Standards**: Agreed-upon complexity benchmarks

### Practical Process
- **Estimation Workflow**: Step-by-step team process
- **Decision Framework**: How to assign point values
- **Consensus Building**: Handling estimation disagreements

## Implementation Guide

### Step 1: Team Calibration Session (30 minutes)

1. **Gather Reference Stories**
   - Collect 6-10 recently completed stories
   - Include variety of complexity levels
   - Note actual effort and challenges faced

2. **Establish Scale Baseline**
   - Assign retroactive point values to completed work
   - Build consensus on what each point means
   - Document team-specific complexity factors

### Step 2: Apply Estimation Process (15 minutes per story)

1. **Story Analysis Phase**
   - Read story and acceptance criteria
   - Identify technical complexity factors
   - Note unknowns and risk areas

2. **Individual Estimation**
   - Each team member estimates privately
   - Compare to reference stories
   - Consider full development lifecycle

3. **Discussion and Consensus**
   - Reveal estimates simultaneously
   - Discuss significant differences
   - Reach team consensus on final points

### Step 3: Continuous Improvement (Ongoing)

1. **Track Accuracy**
   - Compare estimated vs. actual effort
   - Identify patterns in over/under-estimation
   - Adjust calibration based on learnings

2. **Refine Process**
   - Update reference stories as team evolves
   - Add new complexity factors as discovered
   - Maintain estimation consistency

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: New Development Team
```markdown
**Team Context**: 4 developers, 1 designer, new to working together
**Technology Stack**: React, Node.js, PostgreSQL
**Team Experience**: Mixed (2 senior, 3 junior developers)
**Sprint Length**: 2 weeks
**Points Scale**: Fibonacci (1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13)

**Stories to Estimate**:
- User login/logout functionality
- Product search with basic filters
- User profile editing
- Email notification system
- Shopping cart management
```

### Example 2: Mobile App Team
```markdown
**Team Context**: 3 mobile developers, 1 backend developer
**Technology Stack**: React Native, Python/Django API
**Team Experience**: Senior team, new to React Native
**Sprint Length**: 1 week
**Points Scale**: Modified Fibonacci (1, 2, 3, 5, 8)

**Stories to Estimate**:
- Native camera integration
- Offline data synchronization
- Push notification setup
- Social media login
- In-app purchase integration
```

### Example 3: Legacy System Team
```markdown
**Team Context**: 5 developers working on legacy modernization
**Technology Stack**: Java legacy system, React frontend
**Team Experience**: Very senior, familiar with codebase
**Sprint Length**: 3 weeks
**Points Scale**: Linear (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8)

**Stories to Estimate**:
- Migrate user authentication module
- Replace deprecated API endpoints
- Update database schema for new features

```

## Claude Code Optimization

### Integration Workflow
```bash
# Before sprint planning
claude-code --template=DP-F-003 --input=sprint-backlog.md

# During estimation session
git checkout -b sprint-planning/{sprint-number}
# Use AI assistance for complex story analysis

# After estimation
git add sprint-planning-results.md
git commit -m "Complete story point estimation for Sprint X"
```

### Team Process Enhancement
- **Pre-planning**: Use AI to analyze stories before team session
- **During Planning**: Reference AI suggestions during discussion
- **Post-planning**: Document decisions and calibration updates

## Effectiveness Metrics

### Estimation Accuracy
- **Velocity Stability**: Sprint velocity varies less than 20%
- **Story Completion**: 85% of estimated stories completed per sprint
- **Effort Prediction**: Actual effort within 30% of estimates

### Team Alignment
- **Estimation Consensus**: Less than 10% disagreement on story points
- **Calibration Consistency**: New stories estimated consistently
- **Process Adoption**: Team follows estimation process 95% of time

### Planning Benefits
- **Sprint Predictability**: Consistent delivery across sprints
- **Capacity Planning**: Accurate sprint commitment decisions
- **Stakeholder Communication**: Reliable delivery predictions

## Common Pitfalls and Solutions

**Over-precision**: Remember points are relative, not absolute time
**Analysis paralysis**: Set time limits for estimation discussions
**Individual bias**: Use team consensus, not individual preferences
**Scale drift**: Regularly recalibrate with completed work

## Estimation Guidelines by Complexity

### 1 Point Stories
- Simple UI changes
- Configuration updates
- Minor bug fixes
- Well-understood features

### 2-3 Point Stories
- Standard CRUD operations
- Typical API integrations
