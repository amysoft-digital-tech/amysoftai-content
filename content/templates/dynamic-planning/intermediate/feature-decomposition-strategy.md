# Feature Decomposition Strategy Template

## Template Purpose
Break down complex features into manageable development units with clear acceptance criteria, user stories, and technical implementation guidance.

## Usage Context
Use this template when:
- Decomposing large features into smaller, manageable development tasks
- Creating user stories with clear acceptance criteria for agile development
- Planning feature development with proper dependency identification
- Establishing clear boundaries between related feature components
- Optimizing development velocity through proper work breakdown

## Template Prompt

```
**Context**: Feature Decomposition Strategy for {FEATURE_NAME}

I need to decompose the {FEATURE_NAME} feature for {PROJECT_NAME}. This feature serves {TARGET_USERS} and supports the following business objectives: {BUSINESS_OBJECTIVES}.

**Feature Overview**: {FEATURE_DESCRIPTION}

**User Personas**: {USER_PERSONAS}

**Business Requirements**: {BUSINESS_REQUIREMENTS}

**Technical Context**: {TECHNICAL_CONTEXT}

**Integration Requirements**: {INTEGRATION_REQUIREMENTS}

**Success Metrics**: {SUCCESS_METRICS}

Please provide a comprehensive feature decomposition including:

## 1. Feature Analysis and Context

### Business Value Proposition
- Core business problem this feature solves
- Target user segments and their specific needs
- Expected business impact and success metrics
- Competitive advantage and market positioning

### User Journey Mapping
- Primary user workflows and interaction patterns
- Entry points and user goals for each workflow
- Pain points addressed and user experience improvements
- Cross-feature dependencies and user flow connections

### Technical Architecture Overview
- High-level system components involved
- Data flow and integration requirements
- Security and compliance considerations
- Performance and scalability requirements

## 2. User Story Decomposition

### Epic-Level User Stories
For each major user workflow, create epic-level stories:

**Epic**: [Epic Name]
- **As a** [user type]
- **I want** [capability]
- **So that** [business value]
- **Acceptance Criteria**: [high-level success criteria]
- **Story Points**: [complexity estimate]
- **Dependencies**: [other epics or external dependencies]

### Feature-Level User Stories
Break down each epic into feature-level stories:

**Story**: [Story Name]
- **As a** [specific user persona]
- **I want** [specific functionality]
- **So that** [specific benefit]
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - Given [context]
  - When [action]
  - Then [expected outcome]
- **Definition of Done**: [completion criteria]
- **Story Points**: [effort estimate]
- **Priority**: [MoSCoW or numerical priority]

### Task-Level Breakdown
For each user story, identify implementation tasks:

**Development Tasks**:
- Frontend components and user interface
- Backend API endpoints and business logic
- Database schema and data access layer
- Integration with external systems

**Quality Assurance Tasks**:
- Unit test development and coverage
- Integration test scenarios
- User acceptance test cases
- Performance and security testing

## 3. Acceptance Criteria and Quality Gates

### Functional Acceptance Criteria
- Happy path scenarios with expected behaviors
- Edge cases and error handling requirements
- Input validation and data quality requirements
- Business rule validation and enforcement

### Non-Functional Acceptance Criteria
- Performance requirements (response time, throughput)
- Security requirements (authentication, authorization, data protection)
- Usability requirements (accessibility, mobile responsiveness)
- Reliability requirements (error handling, recovery)

### Definition of Done Checklist
- [ ] Functional requirements implemented and tested
- [ ] Non-functional requirements validated
- [ ] Code review completed and approved
- [ ] Unit tests written and passing (>90% coverage)
- [ ] Integration tests passing
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Security review completed
- [ ] Accessibility compliance verified
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met

## 4. Dependency Analysis and Sequencing

### Internal Dependencies
- Dependencies between user stories within this feature
- Dependencies on other features or system components
- Database schema and migration requirements
- Shared components and infrastructure needs

### External Dependencies
- Third-party API integrations and availability
- External team deliverables and timelines
- Compliance and security review requirements
- Infrastructure and deployment dependencies

### Sequencing Strategy
- Recommended development order for optimal velocity
- Parallel development opportunities
- Critical path identification
- Risk mitigation through dependency management

## 5. Technical Implementation Guidance

### Architecture Patterns
- Recommended design patterns for implementation
- Component structure and separation of concerns
- State management and data flow patterns
- Error handling and logging strategies

### Technology Stack Considerations
- Frontend framework and component library recommendations
- Backend service architecture and API design
- Database design and optimization considerations
- Integration patterns and communication protocols

### Quality and Testing Strategy
- Unit testing strategy and framework selection
- Integration testing approach and test data management
- End-to-end testing scenarios and automation
- Performance testing and monitoring requirements

## 6. Risk Assessment and Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- Complex integration challenges and mitigation approaches
- Performance bottlenecks and optimization strategies
- Security vulnerabilities and protection measures
- Technology learning curve and skill development needs

### Business Risks
- User adoption challenges and change management
- Market timing and competitive response
- Resource availability and team capacity
- Stakeholder alignment and expectation management

Please structure the decomposition to support {DEVELOPMENT_METHODOLOGY} and integrate with {PROJECT_MANAGEMENT_TOOL}.
