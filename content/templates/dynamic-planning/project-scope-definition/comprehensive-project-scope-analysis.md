# Comprehensive Project Scope Analysis Template

## Template Purpose
Generate complete project scope definition with stakeholder analysis, requirement breakdown, and work structure planning for complex software development projects.

## Usage Context
Use this template when:
- Starting new software development projects requiring comprehensive scope definition
- Clarifying ambiguous or poorly defined project requirements
- Establishing clear boundaries and deliverables for cross-functional teams
- Creating detailed work breakdown structures for project planning
- Aligning stakeholders on project objectives and success criteria

## Template Prompt

```
**Context**: Comprehensive Project Scope Analysis for {PROJECT_NAME}

I need to perform a complete project scope analysis for {PROJECT_NAME}. This project involves {PROJECT_DESCRIPTION} with the following initial requirements:

**Initial Requirements**: {INITIAL_REQUIREMENTS}

**Stakeholders**: {STAKEHOLDER_LIST}

**Business Objectives**: {BUSINESS_OBJECTIVES}

**Technical Constraints**: {TECHNICAL_CONSTRAINTS}

**Timeline Constraints**: {TIMELINE_CONSTRAINTS}

**Budget Constraints**: {BUDGET_CONSTRAINTS}

Please provide a comprehensive project scope analysis including:

## 1. Project Scope Definition

### Core Objectives
- Primary business objectives and success criteria
- Measurable outcomes and key performance indicators
- Strategic alignment with organizational goals

### Functional Requirements
- Core features and capabilities (in-scope)
- User stories and acceptance criteria
- Technical specifications and quality attributes
- Integration requirements and dependencies

### Non-Functional Requirements
- Performance requirements (response time, throughput, scalability)
- Security requirements and compliance standards
- Usability and accessibility requirements
- Maintainability and operational requirements

### Explicit Exclusions (Out of Scope)
- Features and capabilities explicitly excluded
- Future phase considerations
- Assumptions and constraints that limit scope

## 2. Stakeholder Analysis

### Primary Stakeholders
- Role, influence, and decision-making authority
- Key interests and success criteria
- Communication preferences and engagement requirements

### Secondary Stakeholders
- Supporting roles and dependencies
- Information and approval requirements
- Potential impact on project execution

### Stakeholder Engagement Plan
- Communication frequency and methods
- Review and approval processes
- Escalation paths and decision-making protocols

## 3. Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)

### Epic-Level Breakdown
- Major project components and deliverables
- Epic dependencies and sequencing
- Resource allocation estimates

### Feature-Level Breakdown
- Detailed feature specifications
- Acceptance criteria and definition of done
- Estimated effort and complexity assessment

### Task-Level Breakdown
- Development tasks and technical activities
- Testing and quality assurance activities
- Deployment and operational activities

## 4. Risk and Assumption Analysis

### Key Assumptions
- Technical assumptions and their validation requirements
- Business assumptions and validation criteria
- Resource and timeline assumptions

### Risk Identification
- Technical risks and mitigation strategies
- Business and market risks
- Resource and timeline risks
- External dependency risks

## 5. Success Criteria and Acceptance

### Definition of Done
- Completion criteria for each major deliverable
- Quality gates and acceptance criteria
- Testing and validation requirements

### Success Metrics
- Quantitative success measures
- Qualitative assessment criteria
- Long-term value realization metrics

## 6. Project Boundaries and Interfaces

### System Boundaries
- Integration points with existing systems
- Data flow and API requirements
- Security and access control boundaries

### Organizational Boundaries
- Team responsibilities and ownership
- Cross-functional collaboration requirements
- External vendor and partner interfaces

Please structure the analysis to support {PLANNING_METHODOLOGY} methodology and integration with {PROJECT_MANAGEMENT_TOOL}.
```
