**Team Information**: {TEAM_INFORMATION}

**Historical Velocity**: {HISTORICAL_VELOCITY}

**Technology Stack**: {TECHNOLOGY_STACK}

**Quality Requirements**: {QUALITY_REQUIREMENTS}

**Risk Factors**: {RISK_FACTORS}

Please provide a comprehensive estimation analysis using multiple methods:

## 1. Story Point Estimation

### Relative Sizing Framework
Apply story point estimation using Fibonacci sequence (1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21):

**Reference Stories** (Baseline Calibration):
- **1 Point**: [Simple configuration change or minor bug fix]
- **2 Points**: [Basic UI component or simple API endpoint]
- **3 Points**: [Standard feature with basic CRUD operations]
- **5 Points**: [Complex feature with multiple integrations]
- **8 Points**: [Major feature requiring significant design work]
- **13 Points**: [Epic-level feature spanning multiple sprints]
- **21 Points**: [Large epic requiring decomposition]

**Estimation Process**:
For each work item, provide:
- **Item Name**: [Work item identifier]
- **Description**: [Brief functional description]
- **Complexity Factors**: [Technical complexity, integration complexity, uncertainty level]
- **Comparison Reference**: [Similar past work for calibration]
- **Story Points**: [Fibonacci value with justification]
- **Confidence Level**: [High/Medium/Low confidence in estimate]

### Story Point Calibration
- **Team Velocity**: Average story points completed per sprint
- **Velocity Trend**: Increasing, stable, or decreasing velocity pattern
- **Capacity Factor**: Team availability and focus factor (0.6-0.8)
- **Sprint Capacity**: Realistic story points per sprint considering team capacity

## 2. Time-Based Estimation

### Bottom-Up Time Estimation
For each work item, break down into time-based components:

**Development Activities**:
- **Analysis and Design**: [Hours for requirements analysis and design]
- **Implementation**: [Hours for coding and development]
- **Unit Testing**: [Hours for test development and execution]
- **Integration**: [Hours for integration and system testing]
- **Documentation**: [Hours for technical and user documentation]
- **Code Review**: [Hours for peer review and refinement]

**Quality Assurance Activities**:
- **Test Planning**: [Hours for test case design and planning]
- **Test Execution**: [Hours for manual and automated testing]
- **Defect Resolution**: [Hours for bug fixing and retesting]
- **User Acceptance Testing**: [Hours for UAT coordination and support]

**Deployment and Operations**:
- **Environment Setup**: [Hours for deployment environment preparation]
- **Deployment Activities**: [Hours for release and deployment]
- **Monitoring Setup**: [Hours for production monitoring configuration]
- **Knowledge Transfer**: [Hours for documentation and training]

### Time Aggregation and Validation
- **Total Hours**: Sum of all time-based estimates
- **Calendar Duration**: Conversion to calendar time considering team capacity
- **Resource Loading**: Validation against team member availability
- **Critical Path**: Identification of longest sequence of dependent activities

## 3. Three-Point Estimation (PERT)

### Optimistic, Pessimistic, Most Likely Scenarios
For each major work component:

**Optimistic Estimate (O)**:
- **Assumptions**: Everything goes according to plan, no major obstacles
- **Scope**: Minimum viable implementation meeting core requirements
- **Effort**: [Story points/hours for best-case scenario]
- **Duration**: [Calendar time for optimistic completion]

**Pessimistic Estimate (P)**:
- **Assumptions**: Significant obstacles, scope creep, technical challenges
- **Scope**: Full implementation with comprehensive testing and documentation
- **Effort**: [Story points/hours for worst-case scenario]
- **Duration**: [Calendar time for pessimistic completion]

**Most Likely Estimate (M)**:
- **Assumptions**: Normal development process with expected challenges
- **Scope**: Standard implementation meeting all requirements
- **Effort**: [Story points/hours for realistic scenario]
- **Duration**: [Calendar time for most likely completion]

**PERT Calculation**:
- **Expected Effort**: (O + 4M + P) / 6
- **Standard Deviation**: (P - O) / 6
- **Confidence Intervals**: 68% (±1σ), 95% (±2σ), 99.7% (±3σ)

## 4. Risk-Adjusted Estimation

### Risk Factor Analysis
Identify and quantify risk factors affecting estimates:

**Technical Risks**:
- **Technology Complexity**: [New technology learning curve]
- **Integration Complexity**: [External system integration challenges]
- **Performance Requirements**: [Optimization and scalability challenges]
- **Security Requirements**: [Security implementation and validation]

**Team and Resource Risks**:
- **Team Experience**: [Team familiarity with technology and domain]
- **Resource Availability**: [Team member availability and capacity]
- **Knowledge Dependencies**: [Key person dependencies and knowledge transfer]
- **External Dependencies**: [Third-party deliverables and approvals]

**Business and Requirements Risks**:
- **Requirements Stability**: [Likelihood of scope and requirement changes]
- **Stakeholder Availability**: [Business stakeholder engagement and feedback]
- **Market Timing**: [External market pressure and timeline constraints]
- **Regulatory Compliance**: [Compliance requirements and approval processes]

### Risk Adjustment Calculation
For each risk factor:
- **Probability**: [Likelihood of risk occurrence (0-100%)]
- **Impact**: [Effort impact if risk occurs (% increase)]
- **Risk Value**: Probability × Impact
- **Mitigation Strategy**: [Planned risk response and contingency]

**Risk Buffer Calculation**:
- **Individual Risk Buffers**: Sum of (Probability × Impact) for each risk
- **Portfolio Risk Buffer**: Square root of sum of squares (for independent risks)
- **Management Reserve**: Additional buffer for unknown risks (10-20%)

## 5. Cross-Method Validation and Reconciliation

### Estimation Comparison Analysis
Compare results across estimation methods:

**Method Comparison Table**:
| Work Item | Story Points | Time Hours | PERT Expected | Risk Adjusted | Variance |
|-----------|--------------|------------|---------------|---------------|----------|
| [Item 1]  | [SP]         | [Hours]    | [PERT]        | [Risk Adj]    | [%]      |
| [Item 2]  | [SP]         | [Hours]    | [PERT]        | [Risk Adj]    | [%]      |
