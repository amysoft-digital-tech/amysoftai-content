# Intelligent Review Prompt Templates

## Overview

This library contains 20+ battle-tested prompt templates for **Chapter 7: Intelligent Review** from "Beyond the AI Plateau." These templates address the **hidden pandemic in software development** - the code review bottleneck crisis affecting development teams worldwide.

### The Problem We Solve

- **Average pull request spends 5 full working days in review**
- Top 25% of organizations manage under 4 hours vs. bottom 25% struggling with 36+ hours
- Traditional review has become gatekeeping rather than educational catalyst
- Review bottlenecks create frustrated developers, inconsistent quality, and mounting technical debt

### The Transformation Promise

- **AI pre-review systems provide feedback within 30 seconds to 2 minutes**
- Consistent application of standards vs. variable human reviewer bias
- 24/7 availability vs. business hours constraints
- Scales with computational resources vs. limited human capacity

## Template Organization

### 8 Strategic Categories

1. **[Code Review Acceleration](#category-1-code-review-acceleration)** - Foundation-level functionality and style checks
2. **[Architecture Review Frameworks](#category-2-architecture-review-frameworks)** - Pattern consistency and scalability analysis
3. **[Security Review Automation](#category-3-security-review-automation)** - Vulnerability detection and compliance validation
4. **[Performance Review Strategies](#category-4-performance-review-strategies)** - Algorithm complexity and optimization analysis
5. **[Documentation Review Enhancement](#category-5-documentation-review-enhancement)** - Complete change documentation and context
6. **[Team Knowledge Transfer](#category-6-team-knowledge-transfer)** - Pattern analysis for team improvement
7. **[Learning Opportunity Identification](#category-7-learning-opportunity-identification)** - Bottleneck identification and cultural transformation
8. **[Review Feedback Optimization](#category-8-review-feedback-optimization)** - Human-AI collaboration workflow design

## Usage

### Template Variable Guide

All templates support the following customizable variables:

- `{PROJECT_NAME}`: Your project or repository name
- `{REVIEW_TYPE}`: Type of review (feature, bugfix, refactor, security)
- `{COMPLEXITY_LEVEL}`: Review complexity (simple, moderate, complex, critical)
- `{TEAM_STANDARDS}`: Your team's coding standards and guidelines
- `{TECH_STACK}`: Primary technologies (e.g., React, Node.js, Python)
- `{REVIEWER_FOCUS}`: Specific areas to emphasize in review
- `{DEADLINE}`: Review timeline and urgency level
- `{CONTEXT_DETAILS}`: Additional context specific to the change

### Getting Started
1. **Select Template**: Choose based on review type and complexity
2. **Customize Context**: Replace variables with repository-specific requirements
3. **Apply Template**: Use with Claude Code or preferred AI tool
4. **Iterate Based on Feedback**: Refine based on team needs and results

### Best Practices
- **Start Simple**: Begin with Category 1 templates for team adoption
