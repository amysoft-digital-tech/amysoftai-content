      'Unclear review responsibility',
      'Timezone coordination issues',
      'Workload imbalance across reviewers'
    ]
  },
  
  reviewer_availability_patterns: {
    high_availability: ['Tuesday-Thursday 9AM-3PM'],
    low_availability: ['Monday mornings', 'Friday afternoons', 'weekends'],

    return candidates.map(reviewer => ({
      reviewer,
      score: this.calculateOptimalityScore(reviewer, pullRequest),
      availability: this.availabilityPredictor.predict(reviewer),
      workload: this.workloadTracker.getCurrentLoad(reviewer)
    })).sort((a, b) => b.score - a.score);
  }
  
  calculateOptimalityScore(reviewer, pullRequest) {
    let score = 0;
    
    // Expertise matching (40% weight)
    score += this.calculateExpertiseMatch(reviewer, pullRequest) * 0.4;
    
    // Availability (30% weight)
    score += this.calculateAvailabilityScore(reviewer) * 0.3;
    
    // Workload balance (20% weight)
