### Example 1: Singleton Pattern Implementation Review

```
**Context**: Design pattern evaluation for database connection manager singleton

**Pattern Analysis Scope**:
- Identified pattern: Singleton (thread-safe lazy initialization)
- Implementation context: Multi-threaded web application with database connections
- System characteristics: High concurrency, 10,000+ concurrent users
- Team expertise: Mixed experience levels, some unfamiliar with thread safety

**Code Implementation**:
```java
public class DatabaseConnectionManager {
    private static volatile DatabaseConnectionManager instance;
    private static final Object lock = new Object();
    private final HikariDataSource dataSource;
    
    private DatabaseConnectionManager() {
        HikariConfig config = new HikariConfig();
        config.setJdbcUrl("jdbc:postgresql://localhost/mydb");
        config.setUsername("user");
        config.setPassword("password");
        config.setMaximumPoolSize(20);
        this.dataSource = new HikariDataSource(config);
    }
    
    public static DatabaseConnectionManager getInstance() {
        if (instance == null) {
            synchronized (lock) {
                if (instance == null) {
                    instance = new DatabaseConnectionManager();
                }
            }
        }
        return instance;
    }
    
    public Connection getConnection() throws SQLException {
        return dataSource.getConnection();
    }
}
```

**Expected Evaluation Output**:

**🎯 Pattern Appropriateness Assessment**
- **Singleton Justification**: ✅ Appropriate for database connection pooling
- **Context Fit**: ✅ Single connection pool instance reduces resource overhead
- **Alternative Considerations**: Dependency injection container could provide similar benefits with better testability

**🔧 Implementation Quality Analysis**
- **Thread Safety**: ✅ Proper double-checked locking implementation
- **Lazy Initialization**: ✅ Efficient lazy loading with volatile keyword
- **Resource Management**: ✅ Proper connection pool configuration
- **Improvement Opportunities**: 
  - Add configuration externalization
  - Implement proper shutdown and cleanup
  - Add connection pool monitoring

**⚡ Performance Impact**
- **Initialization Overhead**: Minimal, single-time initialization cost
- **Runtime Performance**: Excellent, no synchronization overhead after initialization
- **Memory Usage**: Optimal, single instance with efficient connection pooling
- **Scalability**: Good, but consider connection pool sizing for high load

**🔮 Maintainability Assessment**
- **Code Clarity**: Good, standard singleton implementation
- **Testing Challenges**: Difficult to unit test due to static nature
- **Configuration Management**: Hard-coded configuration reduces flexibility
- **Future Evolution**: Consider migration to dependency injection for better testability
```

### Example 2: Observer Pattern Implementation Analysis

```
**Context**: Design pattern evaluation for real-time notification system

**Implementation Context**:
- Pattern: Observer pattern for user notification system
- System characteristics: Real-time notifications, 100K+ active users
- Performance requirements: <100ms notification delivery
- Team expertise: Intermediate, familiar with basic observer concepts

**Code Implementation**:
```typescript
interface Observer {
  update(notification: Notification): void;
}

interface Subject {
  subscribe(observer: Observer): void;
  unsubscribe(observer: Observer): void;
  notify(notification: Notification): void;
}

class NotificationCenter implements Subject {
  private observers: Set<Observer> = new Set();
  
  subscribe(observer: Observer): void {
    this.observers.add(observer);
  }
  
  unsubscribe(observer: Observer): void {
    this.observers.delete(observer);
  }
  
  notify(notification: Notification): void {
    this.observers.forEach(observer => {
      try {
        observer.update(notification);
      } catch (error) {
        console.error('Observer notification failed:', error);
      }
    });
  }
}

class EmailNotificationObserver implements Observer {
  update(notification: Notification): void {
    // Send email notification
    this.sendEmail(notification);
  }
  
  private async sendEmail(notification: Notification): Promise<void> {
    // Email sending implementation
  }
}
```

**Expected Evaluation Output**:

**🎯 Pattern Appropriateness Assessment**
- **Observer Justification**: ✅ Excellent for decoupled notification system
- **Scalability Fit**: ⚠️ Synchronous notification may impact performance at scale
- **Alternative Considerations**: Event-driven architecture with message queues for better scalability

**🔧 Implementation Quality Analysis**
- **Interface Design**: ✅ Clean separation of concerns
- **Error Handling**: ✅ Proper exception handling in notification loop
- **Memory Management**: ⚠️ Potential memory leaks if observers aren't properly cleaned up
- **Improvement Opportunities**:
  - Implement async notification handling
  - Add notification prioritization and batching
  - Implement observer lifecycle management

**⚡ Performance Impact**
- **Notification Overhead**: High for large observer sets (O(n) complexity)
- **Blocking Behavior**: Synchronous notifications may block the subject
- **Memory Usage**: Grows linearly with observer count
- **Scalability Recommendations**: 
  - Implement asynchronous notification dispatch
  - Consider notification batching for efficiency
  - Add observer prioritization and filtering
```
