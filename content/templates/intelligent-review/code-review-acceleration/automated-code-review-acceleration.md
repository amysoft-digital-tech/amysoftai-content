## Implementation Examples

### Example 1: Angular Component Review

```
**Context**: Automated code review for Angular component implementing user dashboard

**Review Scope**: Functionality, performance, Angular best practices, accessibility

**Repository Details**:
- Technology stack: Angular 18+, TypeScript 5.4+, RxJS, NgRx
- Code standards: Angular Style Guide, ESLint configuration
- Testing requirements: Jest unit tests, Cypress e2e tests
- Performance criteria: Core Web Vitals compliance

**Code to Review**:
```typescript
@Component({
  selector: 'app-user-dashboard',
  templateUrl: './user-dashboard.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./user-dashboard.component.scss'],
  changeDetection: ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush
})
export class UserDashboardComponent implements OnInit, OnDestroy {
  // Component implementation
}
```

**Expected Output**: Structured feedback covering component architecture, lifecycle management, performance optimization, and accessibility compliance.
```

### Example 2: API Endpoint Review

```
**Context**: Automated code review for NestJS API endpoint handling user authentication

**Review Scope**: Security, error handling, API design, testing coverage

**Repository Details**:
- Technology stack: NestJS, TypeScript, PostgreSQL, JWT
- Code standards: NestJS best practices, OpenAPI documentation
- Testing requirements: Unit tests with Jest, integration tests
- Security requirements: OWASP compliance, input validation

**Code to Review**:
```typescript
@Controller('auth')
export class AuthController {
  @Post('login')
  async login(@Body() loginDto: LoginDto): Promise<AuthResponseDto> {
    // Authentication logic
  }
}
```

**Expected Output**: Security assessment, input validation review, error handling evaluation, and API design recommendations.
```

## Customization Guidelines

### Adapting for Different Technologies

- **Frontend Frameworks**: Adjust analysis criteria for React, Vue, or Angular specific patterns
- **Backend Technologies**: Modify security and performance checks for Node.js, Python, Java, etc.
- **Database Reviews**: Include specific patterns for SQL, NoSQL, or ORM-related code
- **DevOps Code**: Focus on infrastructure security, automation best practices, and deployment safety

### Team-Specific Modifications

- **Experience Level**: Adjust feedback detail and educational content based on team experience
- **Project Phase**: Emphasize different aspects for MVP vs mature product development
- **Compliance Requirements**: Include specific regulatory or industry standard checks
- **Performance Budgets**: Incorporate project-specific performance criteria and thresholds

## Integration with Review Tools

## Common Pitfalls and Solutions

### Over-Analysis Paralysis

**Problem**: Getting caught in excessive detail analysis
**Solution**: Set time boundaries and focus on high-impact issues first

### Template Rigidity

**Problem**: Following template too strictly without context adaptation
**Solution**: Use template as a guide, adapt based on specific review needs

### Feedback Overload

**Problem**: Providing too many suggestions at once
**Solution**: Prioritize feedback and spread improvements across multiple iterations

### Context Misunderstanding

**Problem**: Missing important project or business context
**Solution**: Always gather sufficient background before starting review

## Advanced Optimization Techniques

### Progressive Review Depth

- **Level 1**: Surface-level syntax and obvious issues (5-10 minutes)
- **Level 2**: Logic, architecture, and security analysis (15-30 minutes)
- **Level 3**: Deep performance and maintainability review (30-60 minutes)

### AI-Human Collaboration

- **AI Screening**: Use AI for initial issue identification and categorization
- **Human Validation**: Focus human expertise on context-dependent decisions
- **Collaborative Refinement**: Combine AI efficiency with human insight and experience

### Continuous Learning Integration

- **Pattern Recognition**: Build knowledge base of common issues and solutions
- **Team Feedback Loop**: Incorporate reviewer and author feedback into template evolution
- **Effectiveness Tracking**: Monitor and optimize based on actual outcomes and team satisfaction
