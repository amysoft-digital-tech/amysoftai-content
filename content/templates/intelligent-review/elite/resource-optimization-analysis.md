- Current utilization: 90% CPU on primary, 45% on replicas, 95% memory
- Performance targets: <50ms query response, 10K QPS, 99.99% availability
- Cost profile: $15K/month database infrastructure costs

**Database Resource Analysis**:
```sql
-- Problematic database configuration and queries
-- Resource Issue 1: Inefficient query patterns
SELECT p.*, u.username, u.avatar, 
       (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM likes l WHERE l.post_id = p.id) as like_count,
       (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM comments c WHERE c.post_id = p.id) as comment_count,
       (SELECT AVG(rating) FROM ratings r WHERE r.post_id = p.id) as avg_rating
FROM posts p 
JOIN users u ON p.user_id = u.id 
WHERE p.created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '7 days'
ORDER BY p.created_at DESC 
LIMIT 50;

-- Resource Issue 2: Missing indexes causing full table scans
-- posts table (10M rows) frequently queried without proper indexes
-- users table (5M rows) with inefficient composite index usage

-- Resource Issue 3: Connection pool exhaustion
-- Database configuration:
max_connections = 1000        -- Too high, causing memory overhead
shared_buffers = 8GB         -- Under-allocated for 512GB system
effective_cache_size = 32GB  -- Incorrect cache size estimation
work_mem = 4MB              -- Too small for complex queries
maintenance_work_mem = 64MB  -- Insufficient for index maintenance

-- Resource Issue 4: Inefficient replication setup
-- All read queries hitting primary database
-- Read replicas under-utilized at 45% CPU
-- No query routing optimization
```

   ```sql
   -- Optimized query with materialized view
   CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW post_aggregates AS
   SELECT 
       p.id,
       p.title,
       p.content,
       p.created_at,
       p.user_id,
       COUNT(DISTINCT l.id) as like_count,
       COUNT(DISTINCT c.id) as comment_count,
       COALESCE(AVG(r.rating), 0) as avg_rating
   FROM posts p
   LEFT JOIN likes l ON l.post_id = p.id
   LEFT JOIN comments c ON c.post_id = p.id
   LEFT JOIN ratings r ON r.post_id = p.id
   GROUP BY p.id, p.title, p.content, p.created_at, p.user_id;
   
   -- Refresh materialized view every 5 minutes
   CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION refresh_post_aggregates()
   RETURNS void AS $$
   BEGIN
       REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW CONCURRENTLY post_aggregates;
   END;
   $$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
   
   -- Optimized query using materialized view
   SELECT pa.*, u.username, u.avatar
   FROM post_aggregates pa
   JOIN users u ON pa.user_id = u.id
   WHERE pa.created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '7 days'
   ORDER BY pa.created_at DESC
   LIMIT 50;
   
   -- Add optimized indexes
   CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_posts_created_at_desc 
   ON posts (created_at DESC) 
   WHERE created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '30 days';
   
   CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_likes_post_id_user_id 
   ON likes (post_id, user_id) 
   INCLUDE (created_at);
   ```

2. **High: Memory and Connection Optimization** (Impact: 60% resource efficiency)
   - **Issue**: Suboptimal PostgreSQL configuration for available resources
   - **Solution**: Optimized configuration for 512GB memory system
   ```conf

   # Memory settings for 512GB system
   shared_buffers = 128GB              # 25% of total memory
   effective_cache_size = 384GB        # 75% of total memory
   work_mem = 256MB                    # Increased for complex queries
   maintenance_work_mem = 2GB          # Better for index operations
   
   # Connection optimization
   max_connections = 200               # Reduced for better resource management
   
   # Query performance tuning
   random_page_cost = 1.1             # SSD-optimized
   effective_io_concurrency = 200     # SSD concurrency
   
   # Checkpoint optimization
   checkpoint_completion_target = 0.9
   checkpoint_timeout = 15min
   max_wal_size = 16GB
   min_wal_size = 2GB
   
   # Parallel query optimization
   max_parallel_workers_per_gather = 4
   max_parallel_workers = 16
   max_parallel_maintenance_workers = 4
   ```

3. **Medium: Read Replica Load Distribution** (Impact: 70% primary load reduction)
   - **Issue**: All queries hitting primary database, replicas under-utilized
   - **Solution**: Intelligent query routing and read replica optimization
   ```python
   # Database connection router for optimal resource utilization
   class DatabaseRouter:
       def __init__(self):
           self.primary_pool = PrimaryConnectionPool(max_connections=50)

       def execute_query(self, query, query_type=None):
           """Route queries to optimal database instance"""
           
           # Classify query type if not provided
           if query_type is None:
               query_type = self.query_classifier.classify(query)
           
           if query_type in ['SELECT', 'WITH'] and not self.requires_strong_consistency(query):

               return replica_pool.execute_query(query)
           else:
               # Route write queries to primary
               return self.primary_pool.execute_query(query)
       
       def requires_strong_consistency(self, query):
           """Check if query requires strong consistency"""
           strong_consistency_patterns = [
