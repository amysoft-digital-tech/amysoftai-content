```javascript
// User Profile Component Implementation
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import axios from 'axios';

const UserProfile = ({ userId }) => {
  const [user, setUser] = useState(null);
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true);
  const [error, setError] = useState(null);
  const [editing, setEditing] = useState(false);
  const [formData, setFormData] = useState({});

  useEffect(() => {
    fetchUser();
  }, [userId]);

  const fetchUser = async () => {
    try {
      setLoading(true);
      const response = await axios.get(`/api/users/${userId}`);
      setUser(response.data);
      setFormData(response.data);
    } catch (err) {
      setError(err.message);
    } finally {
      setLoading(false);
    }
  };

  const handleSubmit = async (e) => {
    e.preventDefault();
    try {
      setLoading(true);
      const response = await axios.put(`/api/users/${userId}`, formData);
      setUser(response.data);

**Expected Constructive Feedback Output**:

## Code Review Feedback: User Profile Component

### 🎉 Excellent Work and Positive Recognition

**Great job on the overall structure!** Your component demonstrates a solid understanding of React fundamentals and follows many best practices:

- ✅ **Clean separation of concerns**: I love how you've clearly separated the display and editing modes
- ✅ **Proper state management**: You're correctly using multiple useState hooks for different concerns (user data, loading, error states)
- ✅ **Effect handling**: Great use of useEffect for data fetching on component mount and when userId changes
- ✅ **Form handling**: Solid implementation of controlled components with proper event handling
- ✅ **Error handling**: I appreciate that you're thinking about error states - this is crucial for good user experience

### 📚 Learning Opportunities and Improvements

#### 1. **Enhanced Error Handling and User Experience**

Your error handling is a great start! Let's make it even better for users:

```javascript
// Current approach - good foundation
catch (err) {
  setError(err.message);
}

// Enhanced approach - more user-friendly
catch (err) {
  // Provide more specific error messages for different scenarios
  if (err.response?.status === 404) {
    setError('User not found. Please check the user ID.');
  } else if (err.response?.status >= 500) {
    setError('Server error. Please try again later.');
  } else {
    setError('Something went wrong. Please try again.');
  }
  
  // Optional: Log the full error for debugging
  console.error('User profile error:', err);
}
```

**Why this matters**: Users appreciate specific, actionable error messages rather than technical error strings. This improves the overall user experience significantly.

#### 2. **Custom Hook for Data Management**

This is a perfect opportunity to learn about custom hooks! Your data fetching logic is reusable:

```javascript
// Create a custom hook for user data management
const useUserData = (userId) => {
  const [user, setUser] = useState(null);
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true);
  const [error, setError] = useState(null);

  const fetchUser = useCallback(async () => {
    try {
      setLoading(true);
      setError(null);
      const response = await axios.get(`/api/users/${userId}`);
      setUser(response.data);
      return response.data;
    } catch (err) {
      setError(handleApiError(err));
      throw err;
    } finally {
      setLoading(false);
    }
  }, [userId]);

  useEffect(() => {
    if (userId) {
      fetchUser();
    }
  }, [fetchUser, userId]);

  return { user, loading, error, refetchUser: fetchUser, setUser };
};

// Then your component becomes much cleaner
const UserProfile = ({ userId }) => {
  const { user, loading, error, setUser } = useUserData(userId);
  const [editing, setEditing] = useState(false);
  const [formData, setFormData] = useState({});
  
  // ... rest of component logic
};
```

**Learning benefit**: Custom hooks help you separate concerns and make your logic reusable across components. This pattern is widely used in production React applications.

#### 3. **Form Validation and Data Integrity**

Let's add some basic validation to make your form more robust:

```javascript
const validateFormData = (data) => {
  const errors = {};
  
  if (!data.firstName?.trim()) {
    errors.firstName = 'First name is required';
  }
  
  if (!data.email?.trim()) {
    errors.email = 'Email is required';
  } else if (!/\S+@\S+\.\S+/.test(data.email)) {
    errors.email = 'Please enter a valid email address';
  }
  
  return errors;
};

const handleSubmit = async (e) => {
  e.preventDefault();
  
  // Validate before submitting
  const validationErrors = validateFormData(formData);
  if (Object.keys(validationErrors).length > 0) {
    setError('Please fix the form errors before submitting');
    // You could also set field-specific errors in state
    return;
  }
  
  // ... rest of submit logic
};
```

**Pro tip**: Consider using libraries like `react-hook-form` or `formik` for more complex forms. They handle validation, error states, and form submission elegantly.

### 🤔 Discussion Questions and Collaboration

I'd love to hear your thoughts on a few aspects:

1. **Data synchronization**: How do you think we should handle the case where the user data might be updated by another user while this component is open?

2. **Loading states**: Have you considered using a skeleton loader instead of just "Loading..."? What do you think would provide a better user experience?

3. **Accessibility**: What accessibility considerations might be important for this form? (Hint: think about screen readers and keyboard navigation)

### 🚀 Next Steps and Growth Opportunities

**Immediate improvements** (high priority):
- [ ] Add basic form validation before submission
- [ ] Improve error message specificity for better user experience
- [ ] Reset form data when canceling edit mode

**Learning exploration** (when you have time):
- [ ] Research custom hooks and try extracting the data fetching logic
- [ ] Look into React accessibility best practices for forms
- [ ] Explore libraries like `react-hook-form` for more advanced form handling

### Example 2: Technical Depth Feedback for Senior Developer Architecture Review

```
**Context**: Peer feedback on microservices architecture design implementation

**Review Information**:
- Reviewer background: Principal architect with 8 years experience, system design focus
- Author context: Senior developer (4 years experience), leading architecture initiative
- Code complexity: High - service communication patterns and data consistency strategies
- Review scope: Event-driven architecture implementation with CQRS pattern
- Team dynamics: Technical excellence culture, emphasis on architectural best practices

**Expected Senior-Level Feedback Output**:

## Architecture Review: Event-Driven CQRS Implementation

### 🏗️ Architectural Excellence Recognition

**Outstanding architectural thinking!** This implementation demonstrates sophisticated understanding of distributed systems patterns:

- ✅ **Event sourcing integration**: Brilliant use of domain events for state transitions
- ✅ **Command-query separation**: Clean separation maintains single responsibility
- ✅ **Saga pattern implementation**: Well-structured choreography for distributed transactions
- ✅ **Eventual consistency handling**: Thoughtful approach to consistency trade-offs

### 🔍 Strategic Architecture Considerations

#### 1. **Event Schema Evolution Strategy**

Your event design is solid. Consider adding versioning strategy for production resilience:

```javascript
// Current approach - good foundation
const UserCreatedEvent = {
  type: 'USER_CREATED',
  aggregateId: userId,
  data: { email, firstName, lastName }
};

// Enhanced with versioning and backward compatibility
const UserCreatedEventV2 = {
  type: 'USER_CREATED',
  version: '2.0',
  aggregateId: userId,
  data: { 
    email, 
    firstName, 
    lastName,
    preferences: defaultPreferences 
  },
  metadata: {
    correlationId,
    causationId,
    timestamp: new Date().toISOString()
  }
};
```

**Strategic reasoning**: Event schema evolution is critical for zero-downtime deployments and backward compatibility as the system evolves.

#### 2. **Distributed Tracing and Observability**

Consider enhancing the correlation strategy for better debugging:

```javascript
// Correlation tracking through the distributed workflow
class EventCorrelationManager {
  static createCorrelationContext(initiatingEvent) {
    return {
      correlationId: initiatingEvent.correlationId || uuidv4(),
      causationId: initiatingEvent.aggregateId,
      traceId: getActiveTraceId(),
      spanContext: getCurrentSpanContext()
    };
  }
  
  static enrichEventWithContext(event, context) {
    return {
      ...event,
      metadata: {
        ...event.metadata,
        ...context,
        timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
        source: process.env.SERVICE_NAME
      }
    };
  }
}
```

**Performance implications**: Proper correlation reduces mean time to resolution (MTTR) significantly in production incidents.

### 🤝 Collaborative Architecture Discussion

**Consistency model trade-offs**: I'm curious about your decision to use eventual consistency for user profile updates. Have you considered the business impact of temporary inconsistencies for critical user operations like payment processing?

**Scaling considerations**: How do you envision this pattern scaling when we reach 100K+ events per second? Should we consider event partitioning strategies now?

**Failure mode analysis**: What's your approach for handling poison messages and event replay scenarios? I'd love to discuss dead letter queue strategies.

### 📊 Performance and Scaling Analysis

**Event store performance**: Consider implementing event snapshots for aggregates with high event volume:

```javascript
class AggregateSnapshot {
  static async createSnapshot(aggregateId, eventStore) {
    const events = await eventStore.getEvents(aggregateId);
    const aggregate = this.rehydrateFromEvents(events);
    
    await eventStore.saveSnapshot(aggregateId, {
      aggregateVersion: aggregate.version,
      snapshotData: aggregate.getState(),
      timestamp: new Date()
    });
  }
  
  static async loadFromSnapshot(aggregateId, eventStore) {
    const snapshot = await eventStore.getLatestSnapshot(aggregateId);
    if (!snapshot) return null;
    
    const subsequentEvents = await eventStore.getEventsAfterVersion(
      aggregateId, 
      snapshot.aggregateVersion
    );
    
    return this.rehydrateFromSnapshot(snapshot, subsequentEvents);
  }
}
```

**Resource optimization**: This approach can reduce aggregate rehydration time from O(n) to O(log n) for high-frequency aggregates.

### 🎯 Strategic Recommendations

**Short-term optimizations**:
- [ ] Implement event schema versioning for production readiness
- [ ] Add distributed tracing correlation for observability
- [ ] Create failure mode documentation and recovery procedures

**Long-term architectural evolution**:
- [ ] Consider implementing event snapshots for performance scaling
- [ ] Design event partitioning strategy for horizontal scaling
- [ ] Evaluate CQRS read model optimization strategies
