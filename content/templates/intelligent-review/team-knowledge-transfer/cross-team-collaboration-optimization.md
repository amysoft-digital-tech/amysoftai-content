    this.timeZones = timeZoneConfig;
    this.availability = teamAvailability;
    this.handoffProtocols = new Map();
  }
  
  optimizeCollaborationSchedule(collaborationRequest) {
    const participants = collaborationRequest.participants;
    const urgency = collaborationRequest.urgency;
    const complexity = collaborationRequest.complexity;
    
    if (urgency === 'high' && this.hasOverlap(participants)) {
      return this.scheduleSyncSession(participants);
    } else {
      return this.createAsyncWorkflow(participants, complexity);
    }
  }

      handoffs: this.designHandoffProtocols(participants),
      documentation: this.defineDocumentationRequirements(complexity),
      checkpoints: this.createProgressCheckpoints(participants),
      escalation: this.defineAsyncEscalationPaths(participants)
    };
    
    return workflow;
  }
  
  createTimeZonePhases(participants) {
    // Create working phases that leverage each time zone's strengths
    return [
      {
        timezone: 'APAC',
        focus: 'implementation and initial review',
        handoffTo: 'Europe',
        deliverables: ['code changes', 'initial test results', 'design questions']
      },
      {
        timezone: 'Europe', 
        focus: 'architectural review and optimization',
        handoffTo: 'US East',
        deliverables: ['architecture feedback', 'optimization suggestions', 'integration concerns']
      },
      {
        timezone: 'US East',
        focus: 'business logic validation and stakeholder review',
        handoffTo: 'US West',
        deliverables: ['business validation', 'stakeholder feedback', 'requirement clarifications']
      },
      {

## Common Pitfalls and Solutions

### Collaboration Overhead

**Problem**: Excessive coordination overhead reducing individual team productivity
**Solution**: Balance collaboration needs with team autonomy and implement efficient coordination mechanisms

### Communication Fatigue

**Problem**: Team members overwhelmed by cross-team communication requirements
**Solution**: Prioritize essential communication and implement async-first approaches to reduce meeting load

### Cultural Misalignment

**Problem**: Different team cultures creating friction in collaboration
**Solution**: Invest in cultural awareness training and establish shared collaboration norms

### Tool Proliferation

**Problem**: Too many collaboration tools creating confusion and inefficiency
**Solution**: Standardize on core collaboration tools and provide clear usage guidelines

## Advanced Collaboration Strategies
