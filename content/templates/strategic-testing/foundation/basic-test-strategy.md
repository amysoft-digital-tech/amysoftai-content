# Basic Test Strategy Template

## Overview

This foundational template helps create practical testing strategies for projects using AI assistance. Perfect for teams new to systematic testing or those wanting to improve their testing approach without overwhelming complexity.

**When to use**: Starting new projects, improving existing testing, or when test coverage feels inadequate.

**Time investment**: 45-60 minutes planning, 2-3 hours saved in debugging and quality issues.

**Expected outcome**: Clear testing strategy with practical test cases that catch real problems.

## Template Usage

### Step 1: Project Testing Assessment

```markdown
# Testing Strategy Assistant

Help me create a practical testing strategy for my project that balances thoroughness with simplicity.

## Project Information
- **Project Type**: [Web app/API/Mobile app/Library/etc.]
- **Technology Stack**: [Main technologies and testing frameworks]
- **Team Size**: [Number of developers]
- **User Base**: [Internal tool/Public app/Critical system/etc.]
- **Release Frequency**: [Daily/Weekly/Monthly/As needed]
- **Current Testing**: [What testing currently exists, if any]

## Key Features to Test
1. [Core feature 1] - [Brief description]
2. [Core feature 2] - [Brief description]
3. [Core feature 3] - [Brief description]
[List main features that users depend on]

## Testing Questions
1. What are the most critical user journeys that must work?
2. What parts of the system are most likely to break?
3. What would cause the most user frustration if it failed?
4. Where do we have the most complexity or risk?
5. What testing can we automate vs. what needs manual testing?

Please provide:
1. Recommended testing levels (unit/integration/end-to-end)
2. Priority order for implementing tests
3. Specific test scenarios for each critical feature
4. Simple testing checklist for releases
5. Automation strategy starting with highest-value tests
```

### Step 2: Test Strategy Implementation

**Testing Levels Priority**:
- [ ] **Smoke Tests**: Basic "is it working?" tests for core functionality
- [ ] **Happy Path Tests**: Normal user flows work as expected
- [ ] **Edge Case Tests**: Handle unusual but valid inputs correctly
- [ ] **Error Handling Tests**: Graceful failure for invalid inputs
- [ ] **Integration Tests**: Key system components work together

**Implementation Plan**:
- [ ] Week 1: Set up testing framework and write smoke tests
- [ ] Week 2: Add happy path tests for core features
- [ ] Week 3: Add error handling and edge cases
- [ ] Week 4: Set up basic automation and CI integration

## Testing Strategy Framework

### Critical Path Testing
Focus first on the user journeys that absolutely must work:

**Example: E-commerce App**
1. **User Registration/Login**: Users can create accounts and sign in
2. **Product Browsing**: Users can view and search products
3. **Purchase Flow**: Users can add items to cart and complete checkout
4. **Order Management**: Users can view order status and history

**Example: API Service**
1. **Authentication**: API keys/tokens work correctly
2. **Core Endpoints**: Main functionality returns correct data
3. **Error Responses**: Invalid requests return appropriate errors
4. **Rate Limiting**: Service handles load appropriately

### Test Case Generation

Use this framework to create specific test cases:

```markdown
# Test Case Generation for [Feature]

## Feature: [Name of feature being tested]

## Happy Path Scenarios
- **Test**: [What normal user action to test]
- **Expected**: [What should happen]
- **Validation**: [How to verify it worked]

## Edge Case Scenarios
- **Test**: [Unusual but valid scenario]
- **Expected**: [How system should handle it]
- **Validation**: [How to verify correct handling]

## Error Scenarios
- **Test**: [Invalid input or error condition]
- **Expected**: [How error should be handled]
- **Validation**: [Error message, graceful degradation]

## Performance Scenarios (if applicable)
- **Test**: [Load or performance test]
- **Expected**: [Response time or throughput requirement]
- **Validation**: [How to measure performance]
```

## Implementation Guide

### Week 1: Foundation Setup

**Testing Framework Setup**:
- Choose appropriate testing framework for your stack
- Set up basic test runner and reporting
- Create simple "hello world" test to verify setup
- Document how to run tests for team members

**Smoke Tests Implementation**:
- Create tests for basic application startup
- Test core functionality at surface level
- Ensure tests run quickly (under 30 seconds total)
- Integrate with version control hooks

### Week 2: Core Feature Testing

**Happy Path Implementation**:
- Write tests for main user workflows
- Focus on integration-level testing
- Include realistic test data
- Verify tests catch real problems

**Test Data Management**:
- Create realistic test data sets
- Plan for test data cleanup
- Consider data privacy in test scenarios
- Document test data requirements

### Week 3: Resilience Testing

**Error Handling Validation**:
- Test invalid inputs and edge cases
- Verify error messages are helpful
- Ensure graceful degradation
- Test system recovery scenarios

**Boundary Testing**:
- Test limits of system capacity
- Validate input validation rules
- Check performance under stress
- Test network failure scenarios

### Week 4: Automation and CI

**Test Automation**:
- Automate highest-value tests first
- Set up continuous integration
- Create test reporting dashboards
- Establish test maintenance procedures

## Success Metrics

**Coverage Indicators**:
- All critical user journeys have tests
- Major failure modes are tested
- Tests consistently catch real bugs
- Test suite runs reliably in CI

**Quality Improvements**:
- Fewer production bugs
- Faster confidence in releases
- Reduced manual testing time
- Better understanding of system behavior

**Team Benefits**:
- Increased confidence in changes
- Faster feedback on code quality
- Better collaboration around quality
- Shared understanding of system expectations

## Common Testing Pitfalls

**Over-testing**: Don't test every possible scenario initially
**Under-testing**: Ensure critical paths are well covered
**Flaky tests**: Fix unreliable tests immediately
**Slow tests**: Keep test suite fast enough to run frequently

## Integration with Development Workflow

**Pre-commit**: Run smoke tests before committing code
**Pull Requests**: Require test suite to pass
**Deployment**: Include test results in deployment decisions
**Monitoring**: Use test scenarios to inform production monitoring

## Advanced Variations

Once comfortable with basic testing:
- "Performance Testing Fundamentals" for load testing
- "Security Testing Basics" for security validation
- "User Acceptance Testing" for business validation
- "Test-Driven Development Introduction" for TDD practices

This template provides a practical foundation for systematic testing without overwhelming complexity. Start simple, focus on value, and gradually improve your testing sophistication.
