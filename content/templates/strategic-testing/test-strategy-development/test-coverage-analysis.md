# Test Coverage Analysis Template

## Template Overview

This template provides a comprehensive framework for analyzing and optimizing test coverage across multiple dimensions including functional requirements, code structure, risk areas, and business value, ensuring systematic identification of coverage gaps and optimization opportunities.

## Usage Context

Use this template when:
- Conducting comprehensive test coverage assessments for existing or new systems
- Identifying coverage gaps and optimization opportunities in testing strategies
- Establishing coverage baselines and improvement targets for quality assurance
- Analyzing coverage effectiveness and correlation with defect detection
- Creating data-driven testing strategies based on comprehensive coverage analysis

## Template Structure

- Coverage dimensions: {COVERAGE_TYPES} (functional, structural, risk-based, business value)
- Analysis timeframe: {ANALYSIS_PERIOD} (current state, historical trends, target projections)
- Quality objectives: {QUALITY_GOALS} (defect reduction, coverage targets, efficiency improvements)
- Stakeholder requirements: {STAKEHOLDER_NEEDS} (compliance, audit, quality assurance, risk management)

**Technical Architecture Context**:
